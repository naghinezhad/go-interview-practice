Hey Fiber team!

I've been working on an interactive learning platform for Fiber and thought you might be interested in adding it to your community resources. I recently did something similar for Gin, and the team was really supportive.

The platform is at https://github.com/RezaSi/go-interview-practice and covers the main Fiber concepts:

- **Basic routing and HTTP methods** - REST API fundamentals with zero-allocation routing
- **Custom middleware development** - Request/response middleware, logging, CORS, and rate limiting  
- **Input validation and error handling** - Structured validation with proper error responses
- **Authentication systems** - JWT tokens, API keys, and role-based access control

The Go community has been really supportive of this approach to learning, and it's been great to see developers getting hands-on practice with these frameworks. The platform gives developers interactive challenges where they can practice Fiber without any setup - they just jump in and start coding.

The Gin team was kind enough to add it to their community resources:

- **Gin**: https://gin-gonic.com/en/docs/learning-resources/

I was wondering if you'd consider adding a community section to your docs? It could include links to learning resources, community projects, and tools like this platform. I think it complements your existing documentation really well by providing hands-on practice with Fiber's high-performance features.

The platform specifically highlights Fiber's strengths:
- **Zero-allocation routing** for maximum performance
- **Express.js-inspired syntax** for easy adoption
- **Built-in middleware** for common web application needs
- **FastHTTP foundation** for speed and efficiency

Here are the relevant links:

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/RezaSi/go-interview-practice
- **Fiber Package**: https://github.com/RezaSi/go-interview-practice/tree/main/packages/fiber
- **Interactive Challenges**: https://rezasi.github.io/go-interview-practice/fiber.html
- **Challenge 1 (Basic Routing)**: https://github.com/RezaSi/go-interview-practice/tree/main/packages/fiber/challenge-1-basic-routing

Would you be interested in featuring this as a community learning resource? I'd be happy to make any adjustments or improvements based on your feedback.

Thanks for building such an amazing framework!

Best regards,  
Reza

## Additional Notes for Outreach:

- **Best channels**: GitHub Issues, Discord, or direct maintainer contact
- **Timing**: Consider reaching out when Fiber has a new release or community update
- **Follow-up**: If they're interested, offer to create a PR adding the resource to their docs
- **Customization**: Emphasize Fiber's unique selling points (speed, Express-like syntax, zero allocation)
